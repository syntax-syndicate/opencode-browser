# OpenCode Browser Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-02-10

OpenCode Browser is a companion extension for the OpenCode plugin. It automates browser actions based on user requests.

## What data the extension can access

Depending on granted permissions and the sites you allow, the extension can access:

- Website content (DOM text, element attributes, links, forms)
- User activity related to requested automation steps (clicks, typing, selection)
- Screenshots and page snapshots requested by the user
- Download metadata for files initiated by automation
- Optional diagnostics data (console messages and page errors) when debugger permission is granted

## How data is used

- Data is used only to execute the browser automation commands requested by the user.
- Data is passed to a local native messaging host (`com.opencode.browser_automation`) and local OpenCode plugin processes.
- The extension does not include third-party analytics SDKs or ad trackers.

## Data sharing

- The extension itself does not sell personal data.
- The extension itself does not transfer data to unrelated third parties.
- If you use OpenCode with remote models or services, data you request OpenCode to process may be sent by OpenCode according to your OpenCode configuration.

## Data retention

- Most data is processed in memory for the active automation session.
- Console/error buffers are in-memory rolling buffers and are cleared when tabs close, extension restarts, or when explicitly cleared by tool calls.
- Native host configuration files are stored locally on the machine for installation and runtime setup.

## User controls

- You can remove optional permissions at any time in `chrome://extensions`.
- You can uninstall the extension and native host at any time.
- You can disable or remove the OpenCode plugin from your OpenCode configuration.

## Security model

- Native messaging traffic stays on the local machine between Chrome and the local native host.
- The extension requires explicit permissions and site access.
