## Name

OpenCode Browser Automation

## Short description

Automate real Chrome tabs for OpenCode with local native messaging and per-tab session ownership.

## Detailed description

OpenCode Browser Automation connects OpenCode to your real browser tabs so you can automate workflows on sites you authorize.

What it does:

- Open, close, and navigate tabs
- Click, type, select, query, and scroll on pages
- Capture snapshots and screenshots
- Manage downloads and file-input uploads
- Optional diagnostics for console logs and page errors

Architecture:

- Chrome extension + local native messaging host
- Local broker enforces per-tab ownership for safer multi-session automation

Important:

- This extension is a companion to OpenCode
- It requires local setup of the native messaging host
- It operates on websites only after permissions are granted
